# Video-Card
This repository contains schematic for a Video Card developed using Proteus 8 

Horizontal Sync Circuit and Vertical Sync Circuit are used to access the data bits stored in EEPROM which would be displayed on a monitor. The images of timing diagram as observed from the Oscilloscope is attached in the images section for reference

The final design (combination of H-Sync and V-Sync) is a prototype and is not functional as VGA (DE-15) model and Display model were not available in Proteus. 

Design Inspired from Ben Eater https://eater.net/vga
